                <h1>Introduction :</h1>
                <p className='fs-3 ms-4'>Agriculture plays a vital role in feeding the worldâ€™s population, but plant diseases pose a significant threat to crop production. These diseases can be caused by bacteria, fungi, viruses, or environmental conditions, leading to reduced yields, poor-quality produce, and economic losses for farmers. Early detection and proper treatment are crucial to minimizing damage and ensuring healthy plant growth.</p>
                <p className='fs-3 ms-4'> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To address this challenge, our AI-powered Plant Disease Prediction System provides an efficient and accessible solution. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, this system enables farmers, researchers, and agricultural experts to identify plant diseases quickly and accurately. With just a simple image upload, the system can analyze the leaf and provide an instant diagnosis, helping users take prompt action to prevent further crop damage.</p>
